## Personal Budgeting App
# This is an app to assist with personal budgeting using an envelope system
In this app, users will be able to create budgets, add to, spend from, and delete budget line items.
This project will be using Node.js and Express to create a restful API. This is the second installment of the previous personal budget app in my repositories. This current API introduces database integration with PostgreSQL using 'node-postgres'
